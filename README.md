Github repo for the content I created for a presentation I gave on Geopandas for Michigan Python. 

I find preparing and presenting is a great way to learn more about a subject and meet people with simulair interests.

Following this train of thought I gave a talm on GeoPandas for Michigan Python. I find I use this library more and more for my work at DSV as the different API's google offers allow for great spacial analysis. GeoPandas really shines to showcase what you have discovered and is very visually appealing when presenting (especially using leaflet). Please see the video for a walkthrough of the presentation and questions post presentation.

A fun expierience and definitaly not the last one.
